<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: In this post, I'm going to describe some efficient approaches
to estimating the mean of a random variable that takes on only finitely many
values. Despite the ubiquity of Monte Carlo estimation, it is really inefficient
for finite domains. I'll describe some lesser-known algorithms based on sampling
without replacement that can be adapted to estimating means.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Suppose we want to estimate an expectation of a derministic function
<span class="math">\(f\)</span> over a (large) finite universe of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements where each element <span class="math">\(i\)</span> has
probability <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\mu \overset{\tiny{\text{def}}}{=} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(i)
$$</div>
<p>However, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is too expensive to evaluate <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times. So let's say that we have
<span class="math">\(m \le n\)</span> evaluations to form our estimate. (Obviously, if we're happy
evaluating <span class="math">\(f\)</span> a total of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times, then we should just compute <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> exactly
with the definition above.)</p>
<!--
**Why I'm writing this post**: Monte Carlo is often used in designing algorithms
as a means to cheaply approximate intermediate expectations, think of stochastic
gradient descent as a prime example. However, in many cases, we have a *finite*
universe, i.e., we *could* enumerate all elements, but it's just inefficient to
do so. In other words, sampling is merely a choice made by the algorithm
designer, not a fundamental property of the environment, as it is typically in
statistics. What can we do to improve estimation in this special setting? I
won't get into bigger questions of how to design these algorithms, instead I'll
focus on this specific type of estimation problem.
-->

<p><strong>Monte Carlo:</strong> The most well-known approach to this type of problem is Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation: sample <span class="math">\(x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(m)}
\overset{\tiny\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} p\)</span>, return <span class="math">\(\widehat{\mu}_{\text{MC}} =
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^m f(x^{(i)})\)</span>. <em>Remarks</em>: (1) Monte Carlo can be very
inefficient because it resamples high-probability items over and over again. (2)
We can improve efficiency&mdash;measured in <span class="math">\(f\)</span> evaluations&mdash;somewhat by
caching past evaluations of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. However, this introduces a serious <em>runtime</em>
inefficiency and requires modifying the method to account for the fact that <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
is not fixed ahead of time. (3) Even in our simple setting, MC never reaches
<em>zero</em> error; it only converges in an <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-<span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> sense.</p>
<!--
Remarks

 - We saw a similar problem where we kept sampling the same individuals over and
   over again in my
   [sqrt-biased sampling post](http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2016/06/28/sqrt-biased-sampling/).
-->

<p><strong>Sampling without replacement:</strong> We can get around the problem of resampling
the same elements multiple times by sampling <span class="math">\(m\)</span> distinct elements. This is
called a sampling <em>without replacement</em> (SWOR) scheme. Note that there is no
unique sampling without replacement scheme; although, there does seem to be a
<em>de facto</em> method (more on that later). There are lots of ways to do sampling
without replacement, e.g., any point process over the universe will do as long
as we can control the size.</p>
<p><strong>An alternative formulation:</strong> We can also formulate our estimation problem as
seeking a sparse, unbiased approximation to a vector <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{x}\)</span>. We want
our approximation, <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{s}\)</span> to satisfy <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{s}] =
\boldsymbol{x}\)</span> and while <span class="math">\(|| \boldsymbol{s} ||_0 \le m\)</span>. This will suffice for
estimating <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> (above) when <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{p}\)</span>, the vector of
probabillties, because <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{s}^\top\! \boldsymbol{f}] =
\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{s}]^\top\! \boldsymbol{f} = \boldsymbol{p}^\top\!
\boldsymbol{f} = \mu\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{f}\)</span> is a vector of all <span class="math">\(n\)</span> values of
the function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Obviously, we don't need to evaluate <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in places where
<span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{s}\)</span> is zero so it works for our budgeted estimation task. Of
course, unbiased estimation of all probabillties is not <em>necessary</em> for unbiased
estimation of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> alone. However, this characterization is a good model for
when we have zero knowledge of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Additionally, this formulation might be of
independent interest, since a sparse, unbiased representation of a vector might
be useful in some applications (e.g., replacing a dense vector with a sparse
vector can lead to more efficient computations).</p>
<p><strong>Priority sampling</strong>: Priority sampling (Duffield et al., 2005;
<a href="http://nickduffield.net/download/papers/priority.pdf">Duffield et al., 2007</a>)
is a remarkably simple algorithm, which is essentially optimal for our task, if
we assume no prior knowledge about <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Here is pseudocode for priority sampling
(PS), based on the <em>alternative formulation</em>.</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
&amp;\textbf{procedure } \textrm{PrioritySample} \\
&amp;\textbf{inputs: } \text{vector } \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n, \text{budget } m \in \{1, \ldots, n\}\\
&amp;\textbf{output: } \text{sparse and unbiased representation of $\boldsymbol{x}$} \\
&amp;\quad u_i, \ldots, u_n \overset{\tiny\text{i.i.d.}} \sim \textrm{Uniform}(0,1] \\

&amp;\quad S \leftarrow \{ \text{$m$-smallest elements according to $k_i$} \} \\
&amp;\quad \tau \leftarrow (m+1)^{\text{th}}\text{ smallest }k_i \\
&amp;\quad  s_i \gets \begin{cases}
  \max\left( x_i, 1/\tau \right)  &amp; \text{ if } i \in S \\
  0                               &amp; \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
&amp;\quad \textbf{return }\boldsymbol{s}
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p><span class="math">\(\textrm{PrioritySample}\)</span> can be applied to obtain a sparse and unbiased
representation of any vector in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. We make use of such a
representation for our original problem of budgeted mean estimation (<span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>) as
follows:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
&amp; \boldsymbol{s} \gets \textrm{PrioritySample}(\boldsymbol{p}, m) \\
&amp; \widehat{\mu}_{\text{PS}} = \sum_{i \in S} s_i \!\cdot\! f(i)
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p>Explanation: The definition of <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span> might look a little mysterious. In the <span class="math">\((i
\in S)\)</span> case, it comes from <span class="math">\(s_i = \frac{p_i}{p(i \in S | \tau)} =
\frac{p_i}{\min(1, x_i \cdot \tau)} = \max(x_i,\ 1/\tau)\)</span>. The factor <span class="math">\(p(i \in S
| \tau)\)</span> is an importance-weighting correction that comes from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horvitz%E2%80%93Thompson_estimator">Horvitz-Thompson estimator</a>
(modified slightly from its usual presentation to estimate means),
<span class="math">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{q_i} \cdot f(i) \cdot \boldsymbol{1}[ i \in S]\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(S\)</span> is sampled according to some process with inclusion probabilities <span class="math">\(q_i = p(i
\in S)\)</span>. In the case of priority sampling, we have an auxiliary variable for
<span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> that makes computing <span class="math">\(q_i\)</span> easy. Thus, for priority sampling, we can use
<span class="math">\(q_i = p(i \in S | \tau)\)</span>. This auxillary variable adds a tiny bit extra noise
in our estimator, which is tantamount to one extra sample.</p>
<p><button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggle('#ps-unbiased');">Show proof of
unbiasedness</button> <div id="ps-unbiased" class="derivation"
style="display:none;"> <strong>Proof of unbiasedness</strong>. The following proof is a
little different from that in the priority sampling papers. I think it's more
straightforward. More importantly, it shows how we can extend the method to
sample from slightly different without-replacement distributions (as long as we
can compute <span class="math">\(q_i = p(i \in S | \tau)\)</span>).</p>

<p><strong>Remarks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Priority sampling satisfies our task criteria: it is both unbiased and sparse
   (i.e., under the evaluation budget).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority sampling can be straighforwardly generalized to support streaming
   <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, since the keys and threshold can be computed as we run, which means it
   can be stopped at any time, in principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority sampling was designed for estimating subset sums, i.e., estimating
   <span class="math">\(\sum_{i \in I} x_i\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(I \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}\)</span>. In this setting,
   the set of sampled items <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is chosen to be "representative" of the
   population, albeit much smaller. In the subset sum setting, priority sampling
   has been shown to have near-optimal variance
   <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~szegedy/PUBLICATIONS/full1.pdf">(Szegedy, 2005)</a>.
   Specifically, priority sampling with <span class="math">\(m\)</span> samples is no worse than the best
   possible <span class="math">\((m-1)\)</span>-sparse estimator in terms of variance. Of course, when
   estimating <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> some knowledge about <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, we can obviously be used to beat
   PS. <!-- We can relate subset sums to estimating <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> by interpreting
   <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{x} = \alpha\!\cdot\! \boldsymbol{p}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, scaling
   <span class="math">\(f\)</span> appropriately by <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, and encoding the subset via indicators in
   <span class="math">\(f\)</span>'s dimensions. -->
   <!-- (e.g.,. via
   <a href="http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2016/05/28/the-optimal-proposal-distribution-is-not-p/">importance sampling</a>
   or by modifying PS to sample proportional to <span class="math">\(x_i = p_i \!\cdot\! |f_i|\)</span> (as
   well as other straightforward modifications), but presumably with a surrogate
   for <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span> because we don't want to evaluate it). --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Components of the estimate <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{s}\)</span> are uncorrelated, i.e.,
   <span class="math">\(\textrm{Cov}[s_i, s_j] = 0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(i \ne j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m \ge 2\)</span>. This is surprising
   since <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(s_j\)</span> are related via the threshold <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we instead sample <span class="math">\(u_1, \ldots, u_n \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim}
   -\textrm{Exponential}(1)\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(S\)</span> will be sampled according to the <em>de facto</em>
   sampling without replacement scheme (e.g., <code>numpy.random.sample(..., replace=False)</code>),
   known as probability proportional to size without replacement (PPSWOR).
   To we can then adjust our estimator
   <div class="math">$$
   \widehat{\mu}_{\text{PPSWOR}} = \sum_{i \in S} \frac{p_i}{q_i} f(i)
   $$</div>
   where <span class="math">\(q_i = p(i \in S|\tau) = p(k_i &gt; \tau) = 1-\exp(-x_i \!\cdot\!
   \tau)\)</span>. This estimator performs about as well as priority sampling. It
   inherits my proof of unbiasedness (above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is an auxiliary variable that is introduced to break complex
   dependencies between keys. Computing <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>'s distribution is complicated
   because it is an order statistic of non-identically distributed random
   variates; this means we can't rely on symmetry to make summing over
   permutations efficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--
 - The one downside of this method is that sampling seems to require looking at
   all $n$ items.
-->

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>You can get the Jupyter notebook for replicating this experiment
<a href="https://github.com/timvieira/blog/blob/master/content/notebook/Priority%20Sampling.ipynb">here</a>.
So download the notebook and play with it!</p>
<p>The improvement of priority sampling (PS) over Monte Carlo (MC) is pretty
nice. I've also included PPSWOR, which seems pretty indistinguishable from PS so
I won't really bother to discuss it. Check out the results!</p>

<p>The shaded region indicates the 10% and 90% percentiles over 20,000
replications, which gives a sense of the variability of each estimator. The
x-axis is the sampling budget, <span class="math">\(m \le n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The plot shows a small example with <span class="math">\(n=50\)</span>. We see that PS's variability
actually goes to zero, unlike Monte Carlo, which is still pretty inaccurate even
at <span class="math">\(m=n\)</span>. (Note that MC's x-axis measures raw evaluations, not distinct ones.)</p>
